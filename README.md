## Description ##

With WP Freshdesk you can easily connect your WordPress site with your Freshdesk account. For all the WordPress users, it fetches their tickets from Freshdesk and displays them in a beautiful list with just simple shortcodes.

It also provides Single Sign-On to be configured between WordPress and Freshdesk, so that once the user is logged in to WordPress site, they don't have to re-login on Freshdesk to view their tickets.
